# soilfoodwebs_demonstration
A repository of R code demonstrating the functions in soilfoodwebs

## Scripts
1. Figure1_parameter_uncertainty produces Figure 1 that calculates the consumption of nematode species considering mean and variance in field estiamtes of equilibrium biomass.
1. Figure2_decompexpt_example returns Figure 2 showing a decomposition experiment over time and the effects of oribatids on the decomposition rate in the Holtkamp food web.
1. Figure3_CNsim_example returns the Figure 3 showing the results of a simulation in the CPER web over time.
1. FigureA1_CN_sim_computation_time returns Figure A1 and shows two examples of simulation time for the function CNsim.
1. FigureA2_fitting_model_example returns Figure A2 and shows an example of fitting the bacterial and fungal production efficiency assuming that the default parameters in the CPER are the 'true' parameters.
