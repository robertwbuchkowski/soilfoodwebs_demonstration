# soilfoodwebs_demonstration
A repository of R code demonstrating the functions in soilfoodwebs

## Scripts
1. direct_indirect_contributions produces Figure 2 by calculating the direct and indirect contributions of each trophic species. You can use this script to get the raw data used in each boxplot. Note: Random parameter draws means that specific values may differ.
1. stability_example returns the stability results present in the manuscript. No plots are produced.
1. CNsim_example returns the Figure 3 showing the results of a simulation in the CPER web over time.
1. CN_sim_computation_time returns Figure A1 and shows two examples of simulation time for the function CNsim.
1. decompexpt_example returns Figure 1 showing a decomposition experiment over time and the effects of oribatids on the decomposition rate in the Holtkamp food web.
1. fitting_model_example returns Figure A2 and shows an example of fitting the bacterial and fungal production efficiency assuming that the default parameters in the CPER are the 'true' parameters.
